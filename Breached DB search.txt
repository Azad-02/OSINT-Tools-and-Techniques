Have I Been Pawned?

Major social media and tech giants have suffered data breaches in the past.  As a result, the leaked data is publicly available and, most of the
time contains PII like usernames, email addresses, mobile numbers and even passwords. Users may use the same password across all the websites; that 
enables bad actors to re-use the same password against a user on a different platform for a complete account takeover. Many web services offer to check 
if your email address or phone number is in a leaked database; HaveIBeenPwned is one of the free services.
