What is OSINT?

OSINT is gathering and analysing publicly available data for intelligence purposes, which includes information collected from the 
internet, mass media, specialist journals and research, photos, and geospatial information. The information can be accessed via the 
open internet (indexed by search engines), closed forums (not indexed by search engines) and even the deep and dark web. People tend 
to leave much information on the internet that is publicly available and later on results in impersonation, identity theft etc.
