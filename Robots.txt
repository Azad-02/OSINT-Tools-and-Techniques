Robots.txt

The robots.txt is a publicly accessible file created by the website administrator and intended for search engines to allow or disallow indexing 
of the website's URLs. All websites have their robots.txt file directly accessible through the domain's main URL. It is a kind of communication 
mechanism between websites and search engine crawlers. Since the file is publicly accessible, it doesn't mean anyone can edit or modify it. You 
can access robots.txt by simply appending robots.txt at the end of the website URL.

For example.
	www.google.com/robots.txt
