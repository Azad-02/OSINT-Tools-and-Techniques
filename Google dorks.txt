Google Dorks

Google Dorking involves using specialist search terms and advanced search operators to find results that are not usually displayed using regular 
search terms. You can use them to search specific file types, cached versions of a particular site, websites containing specific text etc. Bad 
actors widely use it to locate website configuration files and loopholes left due to bad coding practices. 

Some of the widely used Google dorks are mentioned below:
1. inurl: Searches for a specified text in all indexed URLs. 
        For example, 'inurl:hacking' will fetch all URLs containing the word "hacking".
2. filetype: Searches for specified file extensions. 
        For example, 'filetype:pdf "hacking" ' will bring all pdf files containing the word "hacking". 
3. site: Searches all the indexed URLs for the specified domain. 
        For example, 'site:hostname.com' will bring all the indexed URLs from  hostname.com.
4. cache: Get the latest cached version by the Google search engine. 
        For example, 'cache:hostname.com'.
5. intitle: Enables users to find web pages with a certain word or phrase in the title.
        For example, 'intitle:final.attendee.list "Fraud" '

        For example, 'Skopenow intext:OSINT', 'keyword1 intext:keyword2'

        For example, 'map:locationname'
9. *: Wildcard - Represents a wildcard within search strings, taking the place of words or phrases between two keywords.
        For example, 'keyword1*keyword2', 'robdouglas*com' 
10. -: Not search term - Minus operator enables users to exclude a word or phrase from search results.
        For example, 'Github -www.github.com' searches for Github but excludes www.github.com.
11. + or AND: Enables searching for results that must include two different words phrases. Searching for both X and Y.
        For example, 'Keyword1ANDkeyword2', 'keyword1+keyword2'
